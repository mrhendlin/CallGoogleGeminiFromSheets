Call Google Gemini /  BARD from Google Sheets directly and for free.

Here's a quick app script I put together so you can simply use =BARD() from within a gsheet



1. get your api key from google https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

2. in a gsheet, click "extensions" then "app script"

3. copy + paste the code here into code . gs

4. hit 'run' and give permissions 

5. viola! you can now use =BARD(prompt) in gsheets!




Per Google: "Right now, developers have free access to Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision through Google AI Studio, with up to 60 requests per minute, making it suitable for most app development needs."
